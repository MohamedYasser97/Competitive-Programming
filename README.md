# Competitive-Programming

This repository contains solutions to some problems on online judges like Codeforces (others will be added later).

The solutions in this repository are the result of 2 years of learning, frustration and the joy of seeing the green "Accepted".

So be warned that some of the solutions contain unnecessary programming practices and naiive code coming from a complete programming beginner back from 2015.
